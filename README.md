Some of my old puppet files

This repo contains some of old puppet modules I've written. I decided to commit only last
revision in order to prevent some sensitive information leakage. However, this
modules are not used any more in any production environment.

Some modules are written ugly, but they worked. They were to be rewritten but
it never happened in this case.
